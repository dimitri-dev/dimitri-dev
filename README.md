Hello there!
</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a 20 year old .NET Developer with a deep passion for cars, especially those with rotary engines.
<br>
Cars have always captivated my imagination, and my love for them started early through automotive games.
<br> <br>
When I'm not coding, I'm often found tinkering with cars, exploring and discovering new things about car mechanics and tuning.
<br>
The creativity and problem-solving involved in working on cars fascinate me, and I believe these skills translate well into my work as a developer.
<br> <br>
I'm excited to see where my career in development leads me, and I'm always happy to connect with people who share my love for cars, gaming, and tech.
<br>
Don't hesitate to reach out to me, let's have a chat!
