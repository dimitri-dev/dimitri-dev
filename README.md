<h1 align="center">
Hello there!<br>
My name is Neven Marić, a Junior .NET Backend Developer!
</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a 19 year old with lots of different interests.<br>
<br>
Developing nicely architectured software that has clean, maintainable and presentable code is my programming passion.<br>
I utilize C#, my go-to programming language, to do most of the programming in my life.<br>
<br>
My free time is being used to study UI/UX in Web design. <br>
I am also brushing my web development skills and learning about new technologies and stacks at the same time!<br>
<br>
Outside of programming, there is also an ever-so-growing passion for cars and motorcycles in my heart.<br>
My current obsesion is the **rotary** engine and the produced vehicles with it!
